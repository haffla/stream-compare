####Requirements

What you need:

- Java 8 (It should work with 7, too, but I did not test it)
- [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Start the Node development server with react-hot-reload:

```
npm start
```
    
Compile and run the Play application:

```
sbt run
```
